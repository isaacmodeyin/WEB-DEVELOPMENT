    <br>   <bold>Avogadros</bold> law states that equal 
    <i>volume</i> of all gases under the same conditon of temperature and pressure contains the same numbers of molecules
    <p>simple harmonic motion is the motion if an object whose acceleration is proportional to it's distance <b>from a fixed point and it is always proportional</b> towards that point<br>Brownian's motion or movement is an evidence that molecules exists in matter and that the molecules are continuall <em>in motion this makes us look considerable at a body</em><b>of smoke, when a body of smoke is kindked of lightened smoke is seen to move upward into the sky</b> <i>the smoke moves in a direction or path that is not straight,</i><strong>the non-linear movement of the smoke is an evidence of</strong> <b>Brownian's Motion.</b></p>
