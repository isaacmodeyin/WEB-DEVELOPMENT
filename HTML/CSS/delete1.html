        <p align="right">Hi</p>

        <p align="left">My name is Steven  Perkins,</p>

        <p align="left">And in this <strong>short  and controversial</strong><strong> </strong>video...I will reveal the <strong><em>disturbing truth</em></strong> about one of the world’s most  brilliant inventors of all history...</p>

        <p align="left">...and the shocking evidence that this Man of Mystery  DID father a child...his <strong>last apprentice</strong>…that  knew all his secrets…and secretly continued his work…</p>

        <p align="left">I will reveal for the <strong>first time</strong><strong> </strong>the video demonstration of how this  young man managed to crack the code and ultimately MASTER his father’s  invention…a device that can <strong>help you slash  your electric bill almost overnight...</strong><strong> </strong></p>

        <p align="left">I don't know how much longer I'll have this free presentation  online...</p>

        <p align="left">So, if you stick around until the end of this short presentation…</p>

        <p align="left">I will reveal how you, like the other 37,311 people, with  the aid of a <strong>very simple </strong>device...</p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:30px" color="red">Can Save Up To <strong>67% Or More </strong>On Your Power Bill <strong>Every Month</strong>...</p>

        <p align="left">...and can pay as less as $20 instead of  $100...or $50...instead of $250 on your monthly electricity bills...for the  rest of your life. <br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Before  revealing you what this is all about...allow me a few moments to tell you the  story behind this <strong>incredible discovery</strong>…and  how it all started…</p>

        <p align="left">You probably heard of history’s biggest electrical GENIUS...his  inventions and his life’s work…</p>

        <p align="left">          Your way of life today, the technology you take  for granted, is all possible because of this one incredible man from Europe.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">What you might not realize is that  coming up with all these amazing inventions that changed the world...came with  a price…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">He sacrificed his private life to provide the  entire world with <strong>freedom</strong>… <br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">He was never known to have had a child, marry or  have relations…<br>

        <p align="left">Honestly, what I'm about to reveal to you today <strong>will totally SHOCK you</strong>...and in  a few minutes from now you’ll be FURIOUS that you ever gave a single thin-dime  to those corporate fat-cats.</p>

        <p align="left">          Recent leaked evidence reveals that  the super-genius DID have a son…</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom:0px">…A brilliant engineer who <strong>secretly</strong> worked side-by-side with him until his death in 1943…</p>

        <center><img class="img-responsive arthur" src="https://energizer-f4d5.kxcdn.com/img/new/arthur.jpg"></center><br>

        <p><strong>Arthur Matthews</strong> was born in England and his alleged father was the laboratory assistant of the noted physicist Lord Kelvin back in the 1890s…</p>

        <p>The notorious inventor once came over to England to meet Kelvin and convince him that Alternating Current was more efficient than Direct Current…and on this visit he also met Mr. Matthews…<em>father and son…</em></p>

        <p align="left">Arthur  Mathews was at that time…just a boy…yet the remarkable  scientist  somehow took such an interest in this boy…that when he was just 16 he took him  as <strong>his apprentice</strong> and thought him <strong>everything</strong> he knew about electrical  engineering.</p>

        <p>Mathews was <strong>the LAST MAN who worked hand-in-hand</strong> with “the mad scientist”…and in return for his unconditional loyalty…</p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px" class="red_text head_2">The Young Apprentice Got To Discover All Of The <strong>Super-Genius’ Secrets.</strong></p>

        <p align="left">Yet  you may ask… If Arthur was indeed the son of one of our world’s most brilliant  minds, <strong>why the secrecy?</strong>&nbsp; Why a secret son, set up in a rural area  of Canada?</p>

        <p align="left">          Well,  think it over and you’ll <strong>realize</strong> that if people knew that inventor of the Particle Beam weapon or ‘Death Ray’  had a son, things could have turned really ugly for him…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Just  like it happened with the son of the famous Charles Lindbergh… </p>

         <center><img class="img-responsive" src="https://energizer-f4d5.kxcdn.com/img/new/rsz/lindy-rsz.jpg"></center>

        </p>

        <p align="left">After  his father’s death in 1943…curiosity-seekers to government agents have made the  trek to Canada to tap Mr. Matthews for information. &nbsp;<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">They  would ask, ‘how do you build the <em>Magnifying Transmitter?’</em> &nbsp;<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Arthur  would always say that the ‘answers are in my mentor’s patents, lectures and  articles.’ And that he hung up his hat the moment his master died…</p>

        <p align="left">Yet little did anyone  know that...</p>

       <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px; text-transform:capitalize" class="red_text head_2"> “The mad scientist” gave his son <strong>a very important final mission</strong>…His  life’s dream…The ultimate achievement…Something he never got to finish and  perfect…</p>

        <p align="left">To develop <strong>a small</strong>...<strong>simple</strong><strong> device</strong> that would cost <strong>under $500</strong>,  and that people could use to get <strong>clean,  cheap electricity </strong>forever...</p>

        <p>And give it to the people…only at <strong>the right time!</strong></p>

        <p align="left">And  that’s exactly what he did…</p>

        <p align="left">          Over  the years, he managed to crack the code in his father’s blueprints and  successfully build a machine from his mentor’s designs and was <strong>successful</strong> in transporting power from  the cellar of his home on St. Joachim Street 1.3 miles away to the Cove Fields. </p>

        <p align="left">          He  was able to transmit sufficient power to light lamps on the <em>Cove Fields</em> and used only the earth and NO wires. &nbsp;<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Later  he was able to transmit power to more than 3 miles away at the <em>Laval Hills</em>…finally <strong>proving</strong> the concept was sound…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px; text-transform:capitalize" class="red_text head_2">He <strong>secretly</strong> continued his father’s work  for more than 40 years and closely documented everything and even <strong>PROVED</strong> that it can be done by anyone…</p>

        <p align="left">Building a device that would not only &quot;capture&quot;  the immense energy that had never been tapped before... </p>

        <p align="left">...but also turn it into <strong>clean, green</strong> electricity  that anyone could use to power up their homes.</p>

        <p align="left">As  Mathews said…</p>

        <p align="center"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>The energy <strong>is already in the earth</strong>, waiting for something to move it…Electricity – high or low frequency, is <strong>always present</strong>…the earth being a vastly superior conductor…</em></p>

<p>The <strong>truth </strong>is the right time never came and Mathews died 1986…he didn’t have the chance to reveal his life work to the public…</p>

        <p>…for more than 20 years, it seemed like this was the end of green, cheap energy. </p>

        <p>Arthur’s lifelong dream was buried...and nearly forgotten…</p>

        <p>Well...years ago, my father ended up buying an evicted house near Quebec City…and after moving in, he accidently found a strange looking book among other things… </p>

        <p>He gave it to me a while back but I completely forgot about it until recently. </p>

        <p>This book turns out to be Arthur H. Matthews' notebook or invention book as I like to call it.</p>

        <center><img class="img-responsive" src="https://energizer-f4d5.kxcdn.com/img/new/rsz/notebook-rsz.jpg"></center><br>

        <p>Matthews' diagrams made little sense…I skimmed them over, but, having no engineering experience, nothing caught my eye.</p>

        <p>I had no idea if they had any value or if anyone will ever be interested to look at them. </p>

        <p align="left">I decided to keep  them in an old box for no reason. Till one day when my buddy James came to visit...<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">We were all having  dinner and I was kind of complaining to him about the high power bills and how  they kept piling up...Not having enough between my mortgage, bills, day-by-day  expenses and schooling tuitions, when all of a sudden the lights went off...<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Everybody thought:  „Another blackout...”<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">James<strong> </strong>and I  went into the basement to look for the flashlights and we found the box with  the notebook...<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Being a DIY  enthusiast and having some experience in engineering, James browsed through the  blueprints and&nbsp;<strong>suddenly was in awe</strong>...<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">He asked me if I knew  what that was. &quot;Oh, some junk I kept for no reason&quot;, I replied...<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">It  turns out, <strong>Matthews</strong> <strong>was  right...</strong><br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">The  science is not only solid... <br>

          </p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px; text-transform:capitalize" class="red_text head_2">It's  even more <strong>practical</strong> than it seemed  70 years ago…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">And for  the first time in human history, ordinary folks can finally power up anything  they need with <strong>renewable </strong>electricity...while investing a fraction of  what the inventor ever thought was possible.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">This device  is so <strong>small</strong> and <strong>versatile</strong>, there’s almost NO limit to how you can  use it…&nbsp;<br>

          </p>

        <ul><li>…Use it to <strong>fuel up ANY electrical devices</strong> -  from small clocks, to refrigerators or big screen plasma TVs </li>

        <li style="margin-top:5px">…<strong>Power  up remote</strong>&nbsp;cabins so high up in the  mountains, you’d be crazy to even think about going solar…</li>

        <li style="margin-top:5px">…Take it with you when you go camping&nbsp;- and <strong>enjoy  &quot;mobile clean electricity”</strong> for your caravan or in your tent... </li></ul>

        <p align="left">And <strong>live a better life</strong> with more money in  your pockets&nbsp;with a high-output generator you can build in your spare  time! <br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Yet the  invention was not meant for DIY-ers.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left"><strong>Simple</strong> as it was, it was  still pretty difficult to build for the average guy.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">And  even though you can find some blueprints on a few websites...<strong>you'll discover</strong> that without the proper  instructions, they're pretty useless…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">I’m going to show you <strong>everything</strong> in a minute...but before  this let me share with you what’s so <strong>magic </strong>about this device. <br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">First,  you may ask…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px; text-transform:capitalize" class="red_text head_2">What is the spring that drives it all?<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">All this energy emanates from one  single center, one single source…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Imagine the Sun a ball of  electricity…positively charged with a massive potential of<strong>&nbsp;over 200  BILLION volts.</strong>&nbsp;<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">About a hundred million miles away in  the solar system, the Earth is charged with negative electricity – acting like  a huge “sponge” that creates a virtual expressway for almost 48.115 megawatt  hours of electrical energy!</p>

         <center><img class="img-responsive" src="https://energizer-f4d5.kxcdn.com/img/new/rsz/earth-rsz.jpg" width="350"></center><br>

        </p>

        <p align="left">Now get this: before Mathews, it was impossible to use even a  small fraction of this almost infinite source.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">That’s because most of this energy  “bounces” off the Earth’s ionosphere… and is lost forever into space<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">But with his device - and a few  simple 21st century adjustments – you too can <strong>grab a slice of this unlimited  resource</strong>&nbsp;that doesn’t cost any money…doesn’t pollute…and will ameliorate  your electricity bill forever! <br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">And in the next few moments, you’re  going to see just how <strong>easy</strong> it is to build it yourself.</p>

<p align="left">But here's the even better news: many of the materials contained  in the original plans used to cost a small fortune when the device was designed…</p>

        <p>It took James and I almost a year  to get our design ready. But eventually, we found an <strong>unbelievably easy way</strong> to do it that  costs 4 times less than what I was hoping for. We finally had the perfect  layout…</p>

        <p align="left">In fact, the new blueprints are so <strong>simple</strong>...that  you don't have to be an electrician... heck, a 12 year old could build a small  generator during a lunch break! </p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px; text-transform:capitalize" class="red_text head_2">Just imagine having ALL your  electrical appliances powered by alternative energy

          </p>

        <p align="left">NO more paying through the nose on  electricity...just to make the fat cats even fatter.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Turn on the AC <strong>as often as you  want</strong>...without having to constantly hear that nagging voice inside your  head telling you that you need to turn it off  because you’ll end up paying a fortune.</p>

        <p align="left">You might want to take notes because this will be short  and intense…</p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px" class="red_text head_2">Here's a short video of the device in action:</p>



        <div class="my_video" style="padding:44% 0 0 0;position:relative;margin:auto;width: 78%;-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 28px -9px rgba(176,176,176,1); -moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 28px -9px rgba(176,176,176,1); box-shadow: 0px 0px 28px -9px rgba(176,176,176,1);">

		</div><br>

        

        <p align="left">Keep  in mind this is <strong>the smallest scale</strong> you can build the breakthrough device that generates &quot;energy-on-demand&quot;…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">With larger scale devices the <strong>results are impressive…</strong><br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">So we went back to the drawing board and spent  months writing a detailed manual…not to mention <strong>testing everything</strong> to make sure anyone could build  it in simple steps…and after a truckload of work…</p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 20px" class="red_text head_2"><strong>The Ultimate Energizer  Guide was born.</strong></p>

        <center><img class="img-responsive" src="https://energizer-f4d5.kxcdn.com/img/new/rsz/covertsl-rsz.png" width="420"></center><br>



        <p>And  when you’ll have the <strong>Ultimate Energizer </strong>installed in your home you’ll instantly  be able to: <br>

          </p>

                  <ul>

        <li>…<strong>get</strong> instant savings of <strong>50%</strong>, <strong>67%</strong> or <strong>more</strong>...without spending  months in trying to build solar panels, wind turbines...and paying thousands of  dollars.</li>

          <li style="margin-top:5px">…you'll <strong>enjoy</strong> even greater savings once you discover the three essential tweaks you  can make in less than 20 minutes...that will maximize your power output by  almost 200%.</li>

        <li style="margin-top:5px">...you'll <strong>be able</strong> to power up ANY kind of household appliances - from lamps and toasters, to  electricity hogs like refrigerators and AC units. </li>

        <li style="margin-top:5px">...you’ll <strong>feel</strong> the peace of mind that comes from  knowing that, should anything happen... from a mere broken power line, to a  nationwide blackout...or worse...<strong>your family won't be at the mercy of others!</strong> </li>

        </ul>

        <p>What's more...because the <strong>Ultimate Energizer </strong>is very light and portable, it makes for one of the best  &quot;<strong>emergency</strong>&quot; generators you could ever hope for…<br>

          </p>

        <p>Unlike solar panels, it won't get blown  off the roof by strong winds and hurricanes.<br>

          </p>

        <p>And unlike conventional  &quot;portable&quot; generators, there are <strong>no fumes</strong>... and you don't  have to spend hundreds of dollars on fuel…<br>

          </p>

        <p>In fact, there's very little to spend  at all.<br>

          </p>

        <p>Except from a simple maintenance check  every few months, the generator is basically  &quot;<strong>Set And Forget</strong>&quot;<br>

          </p>

        <p>And because the low-friction design  makes it <strong>so silent</strong>, you won't even hear it running! <br>

          </p>

        <p>So you can install it in your basement  or in your backyard…and <strong>not worry </strong>about weather conditions for one  second…<br>

          </p>

        <p>And even if the SHTF you’ll still be able to have <strong>enough  electricity</strong> for cooking and preserving your food...while others will beg  for a leaf of rotten bread.<br>

          </p>

        <p>More and more people are  discovering the <strong>joyfulness and peace</strong> that comes with <u>Off-Grid Electricity</u>.<br>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px" class="red_text head_2">Here’s Why You Need To Try The Ultimate Energizer Guide Today.</p>

        <p align="left">Quite frankly, there’s never been a better time for a  technology like this to emerge.</p>

        <p align="left">With electricity prices going through the roof, and “peak  oil” just around the corner, it’s only a matter of time before <strong>everyone turns to alternative energy  sources…</strong></p>

        <p align="left">But if you <strong>think  about it,</strong> you’ll <strong>realize</strong> “alternative energy” never really was an alternative. </p>

        <p align="left"><strong>Just try</strong> to go  solar without spending 5-figures on a solar panel system.</p>

        <p align="left">It’s impossible.</p>

        <p align="left">But why even consider such an option…</p>

        <p align="left">When  all this time you can <strong>pay less</strong> than  20% of the energy you’re consuming…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Plus,  why shouldn’t you...since it <strong>takes less</strong> than $208 to have your own  power device ready...and less than 2 hours...<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left"><strong>The Ultimate Energizer is incredibly easy to build -</strong> even if you don’t  have a screwdriver in your home…and with our step  by step instructions, building your own generator is as <strong>easy</strong> as assembling an IKEA chair!<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">It’s also <strong>completely  weather proof</strong>&nbsp;– and it really makes no  difference if it’s raining or if it’s too hot outside. <br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">And because you can use it during the  night, you don’t need expensive batteries to store your excess electricity!<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">There’s no maintenance  costs…breakdowns…clouds…bird droppings…and all the stuff you just don’t want to  be worrying about…</p>

        <p align="left">…in fact, it’s probably just as “<strong>green</strong>” as solar or wind power systems!<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left"><strong>Plus, The Ultimate  Energizer </strong>is extremely <strong>adaptable</strong>…and will completely change the way you look at energy…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">And best of all, it <strong>generates  electricity day in and day out </strong>– so you can slash your bill by 30%...  60%...or even more!

          </p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px" class="red_text head_2">Here’s How To Get The Ultimate Energizer Guide:</p>

        <p align="left">You need to <strong>move fast </strong>on this one, because we simply don’t know for how long  this website is going to stay up.&nbsp;</p>

        <p align="left">The first time people heard about such a device,  things turned out really bad for the inventor…and we fear it might happen once  again.</p>

        <p align="left">But still…we want to get this into as many hands as  possible. </p>

        <p align="left">This technology has already changed the face of the modern  world…and it can <strong>do it</strong> one more time.</p>

        <p align="left">People need to <strong>hear  about this</strong> amazing device – so they can&nbsp;<strong>break free </strong>from Big Energy, and stop paying for  electricity that should be available to everyone.</p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px" class="red_text head_2">So here’s the deal:&nbsp;</p>

        <p align="left">The <strong>Ultimate Energizer Guide</strong><strong> </strong>is available in electronic format, for instant download.</p>

        <p align="left">You could be reading everything in just 5 minutes from  now…and you can enjoy <strong>real savings in electricity</strong> from your own  generator in a few short days.&nbsp;</p>

        <p align="left">You’ll&nbsp;<strong>save hundreds of dollars each month</strong>…and  thousands each year…</p>

        <p align="left">And there will be no reason to go solar, and fork out at  least $20,000 on a solar panel system that pays for itself in 8 long years.</p>

        <p align="left">And given all of that…

          </p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px" class="red_text head_2">How much is it worth to you to literally get green, cheap  electricity for good?&nbsp;</p>

        <p align="left">So I’m not going to ask you to invest  $1000 for this secret even though I know it’s worth at least that.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">It won’t cost you $500, either…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">The whole reason we're even charging  any money for this is only to cover our Research and Design  expenses.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Yet the <strong>Ultimate Energizer Guide</strong> won't  cost you $500, not even $250 though they would be <strong>worth every penny</strong> at this price.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">I’m going to set the price for the <strong>Ultimate Energizer Guide </strong>at just  $69.<br>

          </p>



        <p align="left">But because you're getting here  early, if you act <strong>right</strong> <strong>now</strong>, I'll let you have the <strong>Ultimate Energizer Guide</strong>, including the manual, the schematics, the parts list and  all the step-by-step guides…<br>

          on your trips! <br>

          </p>

          </p>

        <p align="left">You’re  finally <strong>free and independent</strong>… no  longer trapped inside a “legal monopoly” that’s holding you at gunpoint…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left"><strong>The Ultimate  Energizer Guide</strong> is about something <strong>bigger and more important</strong> than money.

          </p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size:32px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px" class="red_text head_2"><strong>It’s  About Regaining Your Freedom And Making A Stand!</strong></p>

        <p align="left">Right now, you`re at a crossroads  that`s not  just going to affect your  bank account but your happiness, your security and the safety of your family  for years to come…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">And the way I see it, three paths lie  ahead of you. <br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">The first thing is to do like most  people: take no action, do nothing. And hope that nothing bad will happen. <br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Let this video end, leave this site  behind and keep feeling like you`re going to have a heart attack every time you  open up your electric bill.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Keep acting like a “power Nazi”  around the house, constantly worrying about every last <br>

          watt of power…&nbsp;<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Keep sweating your ways through the  summers and freezing your way through the winters all because you want to save  a few bucks…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Keep contributing to the PROBLEM… gobbling  up our natural resources and keeping us addicted to foreign sources of power.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Of course, there's a second path -  and that is, to take what you`ve learned today and try to “Figure Out” your own  system for creating real power for your home.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Honestly? You can try this!<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">But would you rather reinvent the  wheel every time you leave the house, or would you rather just climb into your  car and get to where you`re going? <br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">It took our team a lot of time,  effort, energy and work to put together The <strong>Ultimate  Energizer Guide</strong>, to test it and to make sure that  even “non-technical” folks like my brother could follow it and use it…<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">And it’s WAY too easy to mess this up  (and spend a lot of money) while you`re experimenting… <br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">Just buy the wrong kind of panel or  forget a particular part and you`ll end up with a really fancy lawn ornament  that does not generate a single watt.<br>

          </p>

        <p align="left">And if you really want to be self-sufficient...  and not at the mercy of BIG Electric Companies, then you should seriously  consider path #3: &nbsp;

          </p>

  <h3><strong>Still  Here ?</strong></h3>

              <p>There are some questions that I  keep receiving from people, and I’ll try to answer a few here. </p>

        <h3>1. If The  Ultimate Energizer Guide works so well, why aren’t more people using it? </h3>

              <p>There are more than 31,711 happy  families already using <strong>The Ultimate Energizer</strong> but every serious prepper  that uses it won’t brag about it. For some it’s the fear factor - most people  think this is too complex to build. The fact is, <strong>The Ultimate Energizer </strong>is easy when you have the proper blueprint.</p>

              <h3>2. How hard  will this be to make?&nbsp;</h3>

              <p>This is so simple and easy to  build, you’ll kick yourself for not taking up <strong>The Ultimate Energizer </strong>earlier.  The whole thing takes 4 hours, doesn’t require strength, and electric school.  That’s all, and really there’s no excuse for not giving it a try. In fact, if  you don’t want to lift a finger, you can still do this. Just pay someone $50 to  read the blueprints and to put together <strong>The Ultimate Energizer</strong> for you.  It’s more fun than LEGOs... and many of our clients are saying that their  children love it.</p>

              <h3>3. How long  will this take? </h3>

              <p>It will take you a little over 60  minutes to read the blueprints. And that’s it. Building <strong>The Ultimate  Energizer </strong>takes under 4 hours if you’re slow. A lot less if someone’s  helping you.</p>

              <h3>4. How much do the parts cost?&nbsp;</h3>

              <p>To build a small scale of <strong>The  Ultimate Energizer</strong>, you’ll need about $73 worth of parts that you can get  from any electronics store. If you want to scale it up, and get more  electricity, you’ll need more expensive parts, but you’ll find that you can  easily power up an entire home with under $210 in total costs.</p>
